    Fixes:
    * Fixed EnumAlolan crashes caused by 8.0.0+ changing how regional forms are listed internally.

5.0.0 for 7.0
Released February 1st, 2019.

    Major (breaking) config changes:
    * RENAMED THE MOD! We're now "Even More Pixelmon Commands", and we've shed some weight. Original, I know.
    * (regenerate ALL configs, copy back old data manually if necessary)

    Additions:
    * Added a ton of missing forms to /checktypes.
    * Added the showing of levels and abilities to /checkstats. Ability info is localized using client locale!
    * Also added the showing of levels and abilities to /showstats. (hover only)
    * Also added a free re-show option to /showstats.
    * /checkevs: Shows the EV yields from defeating a given Pokémon.
    * /partyhatch: Replaces old /timedhatch party functionality. Has its own optional cooldown, if so desired.
    * /partyheal: Replaces old /timedheal party functionality. Can also do the whole cooldown thing.

    Tweaks:
    * Bumped SpongeAPI to 7.1.0, Forge from 2655 to 2768 with the last pre-1.13 mappings. Might fix some issues?
    * Changed default alias for /checkstats into /gs, as /cs is taken by the super-common WorldEdit. :(
    * Enabled /checktypes showing Alolans by default, as we're now on gen 7.
    * Merged the command listing and /pureload into /empc, using a child command setup. (just like PB)
    * Reload now reloads everything, always.
    * Readied almost everything for gen 7! /spawndex needs some love, still.
    * Replaced /checkegg with /checkstats, which now has all of the old command's features and settings.
    * Replaced /forcehatch with /timedhatch and /partyhatch.
    * Reworded /showstats anticheat wording to be a bit less paranoid.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed /checktypes not recognizing two Tapus when entering their name as two separate words.
    * Fixed Alolan Geodude/Graveler/Golem not showing up as suggestions for the normal ones with hints enabled.
    * Fixed /timedhatch eating money when doing a party hatch with a cost set on a party that has no eggs.
    * Fixed a few issues with excess blank lines on syntax messages. Also hid confirmation stuff from console.
    * Fixed bad copy/paste comments in the /timedhatch and /timedheal configs.
    * Fixed some inconsistencies with shown command parameters.
    * Fixed the accidental double check for valid config folders when reloading configs.

    Removals:
    * Also removed /spawndex's "pure black" option as it seems to have broken. Outlines no longer persist, either.
    * Removed /forcestats for the time being. Needs work, 7.0 broke it good.
    * Removed /upgradeivs + /dittofusion + /resetcounts. They need a LOT of work. May become separate sidemod(s).
    * Removed excessive logging. We'll now log only important stuff, at all times.
    * Removed showFormMessage and showAlolanMessage from the /checktypes config as they're useless.
    * Removed the "-s" shinyness flag from /spawndex due to 7.0 breaking it.

4.1.0 for 6.3
Released June 6th, 2018.

    Additions:
    * Added a Lake Trio ruby enchant check to /checkstats and /showstats, similar to the recent Mew one.
    * Added a %pokemon% placeholder to /spawndex's fake message option, and updated its config.
    * Added no-economy support for everything except for /dittofusion and /upgradeivs, which show clean errors.

    Tweaks:
    * Killed off a few unnecessary messages. Reworded a few others to convey the same info, where necessary.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed "a blocks" typo on /fixgenders, when used from command blocks.
    * Fixed /pixelupgrade console info messages showing up as "PU Info info". Oops.
    * Fixed /pixelupgrade showing it hiding further messages when used from console, even though it wouldn't.
    * Fixed /showstats "This Pokémon is gigantic" when "giant" is apparently perfectly valid, here.
    * Fixed configs for /showstats, /timedhatch and /timedheal showing the wrong altcooldown permissions.
    * Fixed debug logger breaking with a NullPointerException if the main config was broken.
    * Fixed inconsistencies with several command errors. Might cause minor visual glitches -- please report.
    * Fixed missing EVSpecialDefense tag for /forcestats.
    * Fixed some inconsistencies with the /pixelupgrade (command listing) command descriptions.

4.0.0 beta 1 for 6.2
Released February 13th, 2018.

    Major (breaking) config changes:
    * Completely reworked /showstats and its config; it now uses hovers for its info. Regenerate this config.

    Additions:
    * /fixgender: Fixes Pokémon affected by breeding bugs or bad commands. Experimental!
    * /spawndex: Spawns Pokémon based on their Pokédex number. Can add neat effects, like an outline.
    * /timedhatch: Hatches eggs (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.
    * /timedheal: Heals Pokémon (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.
    * Added a fancy Unicode arrow ("➡") to /checktypes and the new /showstats hover mode.
    * Added a Mew clone count check to /checkstats and /showstats.
    * Added an alternate VIP cooldown to /showstats and the two new timed commands.
    * Added battle checks to many commands, as they can't work reliably during battles. Prevents wasted cooldowns.
    * Added Poipole (ID 803) and up to /checktypes and the new /spawndex.

    Experimental console support:
    * /checkstats
    * /checktypes
    * /fixgenders
    * /forcehatch (this command has become kinda useless, may be merged into /timedhatch soon)
    * /forcestats
    * /pixelupgrade (command list, only prints commands that work from console)
    * /timedheal (bypasses cooldowns)
    * /timedhatch (bypasses cooldowns)

    Experimental command block support:
    * /fixgenders
    * /forcehatch
    * /forcestats
    * /timedheal (bypasses cooldowns, can be wired to do stuff like healing zones!)
    * /timedhatch (bypasses cooldowns, can be wired to automatically hatch whole teams)

    Tweaks:
    * Changed a bunch of helper text to hopefully explain things a bit better.
    * Changed many command messages to be a bit more professional.
    * Changed max-IV formatting for commands like /checkstats to italic to work around an external bug.
    * Changed the default numLinesPerPage for /pixelupgrade from 20 to 10 to accomodate smaller chats.
    * Changing command aliases no longer requires a reboot. Experimental.
    * Made /checkstats on eggs only refer to /checkegg if the player has its permissions. Still configurable.
    * Made Alolan Pokémon in /checktypes accessible through the less awkward "/checktypes Alolan NAMEHERE".
    * Made names like "Tapu Koko" work in /checktypes.
    * Moved /showstats from chat printing to a far cleaner and smaller setup using hovers.
    * Rewrote the internal config loader. Mostly helps maintainability, but filesize also benefits.
    * Shortened many console messages. Work in progress.
    * Switched to a #.#.# versioning system again (major/minor/patch) and started keeping proper changelogs!

    Fixes:
    * Fixed /checkegg mentioning free rechecks when no price is set. It'll now continue silently.
    * Fixed /checkstats not showing the nickname on shiny Pokémon.
    * Fixed /checkstats's gender/size/nature line occasionally splitting into two? Hopefully THIS works.
    * Fixed /dittofusion mentioning upgrading instead of fusing in some places. Oops.
    * Fixed /resetcount not recognizing "ALL" correctly because I forgot I never fully finished it. Derp.
    * Fixed /upgradeivs saying legendaries were shiny on debug messages.
    * Fixed Ho-oh not working correctly in /checktypes.
    * Fixed main config not loading correctly if command configs were missing but a main config DID exist.
    * Fixed missing spaces in front of the pipes when showing EVs in /checkstats.
    * Fixed a bunch of other bugs that were too small to mention, mostly formatting issues.

    Removals:
    * /fixevs: As of Reforged 6.2, EVs cap at 252 (gen 6+ cap) instead of 255, making this command obsolete.
    * /fixlevel: The bug it was made to fix (EVs not increasing when at the level cap) no longer exists.
    * Removed a few of the less useful config-set aliases. You can still set them manually.
    * Removed a few older internal aliases that weren't being shown anywhere anyways.
    * Removed baby IV checks from several commands, as Reforged updated to the gen6+ way of doing things.
    * Removed commandCost from /checktypes as this info is easily Googled.
    * Removed per-config versions, as they turned out to be useless.
    * Removed showFixEVsHelper from /checkstats as /fixevs was removed. See "Removed commands" for more info.
